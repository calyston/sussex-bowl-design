# Sussex Bowl Website Design

### About the Project

Sussex Bowl is a bowling alley in Sussex, Wisconsin, which serves the local community of all ages in not only bowling, food and drink, but also other activities such as pool, volleyball and bag toss. The main goal of this project was to give the Sussex Bowl website a modern redesign, as the website's current appearance is outdated.

#### Project Goals

01 - To design a more inviting bowling website that will appeal to people of all ages

02 - To gather the interest of potential new customers who may currently overlook the bowling alley due to it's existing website design

03 - To design a website that coincides with the bowling alley's updated interior
